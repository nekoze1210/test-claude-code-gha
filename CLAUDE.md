# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a minimal TypeScript project with a single `index.ts` file that outputs random messages and emojis.

## Development Commands

### Running the TypeScript file
```bash
npx tsx index.ts
```

Note: This project currently has no package.json, build configuration, or test setup. TypeScript files can be executed directly using `npx tsx`.

## Project Structure

- `index.ts` - Main TypeScript file containing a simple program that outputs messages, timestamps, and random emojis
- No package management files (package.json) present
- No build or test configuration

## Notes

- This appears to be a bare Git repository with minimal structure
- To add proper TypeScript support, consider initializing npm (`npm init`) and adding TypeScript dependencies
